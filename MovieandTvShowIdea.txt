### App Idea: **Movie & TV Show Explorer**

#### Overview:
The app will allow users to explore a curated list of movies and TV shows. Users will be able to browse through the titles, check details (rating, genre, release year, and a short description), and filter by different criteria (e.g., genre, release date). There will be interactive elements to navigate between views, modify settings, and engage with the content.

This project will satisfy all the technical requirements and utilize both **Swift** and **Objective-C** by mixing the two languages in different components of the app.

### App Structure:

#### Main Components:
1. **Main TableViewController (List of Movies & Shows)**:
   - Displays a dynamic list of movies and TV shows using three different types of prototype cells:
     - **Basic Cell**: Displays just the movie/show title and a small icon (genre or year).
     - **Detailed Cell**: Displays title, year, genre, and rating.
     - **Image Cell**: Displays title, large cover image, and a brief description.
   - Data is dynamically loaded from an internal array or from an API (e.g., a movie database).

2. **Detail View Controller**:
   - Displays detailed information about a movie/show when a user taps a row in the TableView.
   - The app passes the relevant movie/show data (title, genre, year, description, etc.) from the `TableViewController` to the `DetailViewController`.
   - Contains an **ImageView** for the cover image and labels for the details.

3. **Settings View (Picker, Sliders, and Stepper)**:
   - Allows users to filter and customize their browsing experience.
   - A **PickerView** allows users to filter by genre.
   - **Sliders** adjust the year range (e.g., movies from 2000 to 2020).
   - **Stepper** allows users to set the number of results to display.
   - **Switch** toggles sorting by rating or year.

4. **Timer & Dynamic Update View**:
   - A timer view that automatically fetches new movie/show data every 30 seconds, simulating a live data feed (e.g., "New Arrivals").
   - The timer will trigger UI updates that refresh part of the screen (e.g., new titles being added to the list).

5. **ScrollView**:
   - A scrollable view will be used on the **Detail View** to show long descriptions of movies/shows, which users can scroll through.
   - **Zoomable content** for images (e.g., zoom into a movie poster).

6. **Segmented Control**:
   - A segmented control at the top of the list will allow users to toggle between viewing just movies, just TV shows, or both.

7. **Collection View Controller**:
   - Displays the same movie/show data as the `TableViewController` but in a more visually appealing grid format, allowing users to view covers of movies/shows.

#### Design Elements:

1. **Automatic Layout**:
   - The app will make use of constraints to ensure the layout adjusts correctly between portrait and landscape modes.
   
2. **Buttons**:
   - The main page will have a button for refreshing the content.
   - A "More Info" button on the movie/show details view for expanding extra content.

3. **Sliders**:
   - Located in the settings view for adjusting the year range filter.
   
4. **Labels**:
   - Used throughout the app for showing titles, ratings, genres, and other text information.

5. **Stepper**:
   - Adjusts the number of results shown in the table view.

6. **Switch**:
   - Toggles sorting by year or rating.

7. **Picker**:
   - Allows filtering by genre in the settings view.
   - Implements the picker delegate methods.

8. **Segmented Control**:
   - Switches between "Movies", "TV Shows", and "Both" categories.

9. **Timer**:
   - Refreshes the list with new movie/show data every 30 seconds, providing a dynamic feel.

10. **ScrollView**:
    - In the detail view to enable scrolling through long descriptions.

11. **Image View**:
    - Displays movie/show posters.

12. **Navigation Controller**:
    - Manages hierarchical navigation between the list of movies/shows, the settings page, and the detailed view page.

13. **Collection View Controller**:
    - Displays movies/shows in a grid format for a more visual exploration.

14. **Table View Controller**:
    - Implements dynamic cells for displaying different movie/show information.

#### Languages & Project Architecture:
- **Swift** will be used for most of the UI and the dynamic loading of data.
- **Objective-C** will be used for managing a core part of the data model and possibly the timer functionality, ensuring proper memory management with lazy loading and manual memory control if necessary.
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern will be strictly followed, where:
  - The **Model** handles the movie/show data.
  - The **View** represents the user interface components such as TableView, CollectionView, ScrollView, etc.
  - The **Controller** manages the interaction between the data and the view.

#### Example of Language Division:
- **Swift**:
   - UI components such as TableView, CollectionView, ScrollView, and DetailView.
   - Event handling (Button actions, Segmented Control, etc.).
   
- **Objective-C**:
   - Movie data model management.
   - Timer-based updates (could use Objective-C for the timer to handle some low-level functionality efficiently).
   - Lazy instantiation of heavy data elements (like movie posters).

This project idea will give you the opportunity to have fun while managing dynamic information about movies and shows, while meeting all the technical requirements.
